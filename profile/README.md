# PantherBots 2582
## About
 We are the FIRST Robotics Team 2582, the Lufkin High School PantherBots. As an Open Alliance team, we make our code free and open-source for anyone to use. We utilize Java as our primary language and the WPILib build of VS Code, as well as PathPlanner to design autonomous paths.
